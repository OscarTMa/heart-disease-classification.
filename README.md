# Heart Disease Classification
**Description**
This project aims to classify the presence of heart disease using the Heart Disease UCI dataset. It explores various machine learning algorithms to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on medical attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more.

`The goal is to demonstrate expertise in:`

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Building and evaluating classification models.
- Developing an interactive dashboard for visualizing predictions.

**Dataset**

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: Heart Disease UCI Dataset.
It contains 14 features, including both numerical and categorical variables, and a target column (target) indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.

**Installation**
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

    1.Clone this repository:
      git clone https://github.com/oscarTMa/heart-disease-classification.git

    2.Navigate to the project directory:
      cd heart-disease-classification

    3.Install the required Python libraries:**
      pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
    Notebook:                                    
    The initial analysis and modeling will be conducted in a Jupyter Notebook, hosted in Google Colab. The notebook file can be found in the notebooks/ directory.

    Dashboard:
    An interactive dashboard will be built using Streamlit to showcase predictions and insights. Instructions for running the dashboard will be added in later stages.
